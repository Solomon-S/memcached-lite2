Design Details: 
Server listens on 127.0.0.1:9889
Data is stored in "data.txt" for persistence across restarts
Added support for real pymemcache clients in server for bonus, tested in test_pymemcache_client.py
Client1 sets two keys with rabdom sleep times
Client2 retrieves the values set with random sleep times
The stress_test.py tests how many concurrent clients can connect to the server using threads.


Performance: 
At around 2000 concurrent clients I started getting errors 
"WinError 10048: Only one usage of each socket address"
I don't know what that means but after that I tried 3000 and it worked fine.
It happened again around 6000 clients. 
Tested up to 10000 clients with little to no issues except for one mentioned above.

Limitations:
Key/value sizes: keys must be simple strings with no spaces or newlines.
Value size is limited by available memory. 
Error handling is generic, nothing detailed
Exptime is parsed but ignored for now.


Only library installed was pymemcache.
